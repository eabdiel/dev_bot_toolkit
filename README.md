# dev_bot_toolkit
Chatbot based dev-tools; the bot will call/execute some of my tools based on text input (currently chatbot_core is the sample ui with simple responces and definitions - other tools will be made standalone first before final bot is available with NLP functions to access seperate tools)
 <Planned tools>
 1. Bulk search/replace content in txt files from FTP
 2. SAP Macro execution (using https://github.com/eabdiel/sap_automation)
 3. Extract XLSX - Iterate through and open each Sheet#.xml file - Remove <Protection tags from them to reset passwords from MS files - re-pack and save to target folder
         
         10/9/2020:---found open source prog from github.com/petemc89 (Thanks Pete!); I've adapted it to the dev-tools ui as standalone prog - next version will be available on chatbot_core.
         
 4. Search functionality for Job log csv (using https://github.com/eabdiel/sap_automation/tree/master/AutomatedGetJob_Data_Analysis_Tool)
 5. File downloader
 6. Target XML url to Spreadsheet
